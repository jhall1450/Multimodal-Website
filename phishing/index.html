        <p>Phishing is an illegal form of social engineering, which is designed to trick users into providing personally identifiable information to someone posing as a legitimate person or business. The type of content typically sought after is account credentials, bank account details, or credit card information.  Most often these phishing attacks manifest in the form of fake emails, websites, or text messages.

      <div class="wrapper">
        <p>Unfortunately, phishing attacks are not always easy to spot. Even the trained eye can make mistakes, but the more you know about what to look for in a phishing attack the more secure you will be. There are a few key identifiers that signify an email may be a phishing attempt, the first of which is grammar & spelling. It is best not to trust an email that is asking you to login to your bank account if there are spelling and/or grammatical errors.
        </p>
        <p>The second major indicator of a phishing attack is a heightened sense of urgency & hyperlinks. Often a phishing email can be recognized if an email from your "bank" is recieved stating that "your account will be disabled in 1 day unless you log in to <a href="#">this website</a>". When in doubt open a web browser and go directly to the website of the business in question. Another option of checking where a link will take you is to hover over the link with your mouse pointer. After a few seconds a little pop-up will reveal the address embedded in the hyperlink. Even if the email itself looks flawless, it is always a good idea to check who the sender is. Ensure that the email is coming from the proper by checking the root domain name of the sender.
        </p>

        <p>The above example shows an email coming from PayPal. We can see that the address it comes from is legitimate by looking at the sender address. The sender of this email is "paypal@mail.paypal.com", and the domain name "paypal.com" is owned by PayPal. This provides a greater sense of legitimacy. Hovering over hyperlinks to show the actual URL it will direct you to is also demonstrated in the image.
        </p>
        <p>One final method of identifying a phishing email is odd attachments & unexpected emails. One should always regard unexpected emails with some caution, but if this email also contains attachments you should be very careful if you decide to open them. Even Microsoft Office files can contain some nasty viruses, so it always a good idea to be careful when opening attachments over email.
        </p>
        <p>To summarize up the previous points, exercise caution if you receive an email that exhibits any of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Grammar & Spelling Mistakes</li>
                <li>Heighted Sense of Urgency</li>
                <li>Hyperlinks</li>
                <li>Unexpected Email</li>
                <li>Attachments</li>
            </ul>
